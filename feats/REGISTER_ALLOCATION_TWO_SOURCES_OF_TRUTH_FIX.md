# FEAT: Register Allocation "Two Sources of Truth" Bug Fix

**Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED  
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Impact**: Register Clobbering, Random Function Failures, Core Compiler Architecture  

## Summary

Fixed a critical architectural flaw in the compiler's register allocation system where two independent components (`LinearScanAllocator` and `RegisterManager`) made conflicting decisions about register ownership, leading to register clobbering bugs that caused functions like `RAND()` to return incorrect values.

## The Problem

### Symptom
```bcl
LET xx = RAND(400)  // Returns random value, e.g., 159
LET yy = RAND(400)  // Returns random value, e.g., 285
// But xx is now corrupted to 400 (the literal constant)!
```

The `RAND()` function would appear to work (returning random values for `yy`) but the first assignment would be mysteriously overwritten with the literal argument value (400).

### Root Cause Analysis
The compiler had **two independent register allocation systems** operating without coordination:

1. **LinearScanAllocator** (Truth #1):
   - Performed sophisticated live interval analysis
   - Correctly determined that `X20` should hold variable `xx`
   - Made allocation decisions but **never communicated them**

2. **RegisterManager** (Truth #2):
   - Managed day-to-day register requests from code generation
   - Had no knowledge of LinearScanAllocator's decisions
   - Treated `X20` as "available" for scratch use

### The Bug Sequence
```assembly
; First RAND call - worked correctly
MOVZ X10, #400        ; Load argument 400
MOV X0, X10           ; Pass to RAND
BLR X11               ; Call RAND(400)
MOV X20, X0           ; Store result in X20 (xx = random_value)

; Second RAND call - caused the bug
MOVZ X11, #400        ; Load argument 400
MOV X20, X11          ; BUG: Overwrote xx's random value with 400!
MOV X0, X20           ; Pass 400 to RAND
BLR X12               ; Call RAND(400)
MOV X27, X0           ; Store result in X27 (yy = random_value)
```

The issue was that `RegisterManager.get_free_register()` returned `X20` for the literal `400`, not knowing that `X20` was already allocated to variable `xx` by the LinearScanAllocator.

## Investigation Trace Evidence

Code generation trace revealed the exact moment of register conflict:
```
[DEBUG LEVEL 5] Emitting instruction: MOVZ X10, #400
[DEBUG LEVEL 5] Emitting instruction: MOV X20, X10    ← OVERWRITES xx!
[DEBUG]   [ALLOCATOR HIT] Variable 'xx' lives in X20. Emitting MOV.
```

The LinearScanAllocator correctly knew that `xx` lived in `X20`, but the scratch register allocation trampled on it.

## The Solution

### Architectural Fix: Unified Register State

Implemented a **synchronization mechanism** to make LinearScanAllocator the single source of truth:

#### 1. New RegisterManager Methods
```cpp
// Sync RegisterManager with LinearScanAllocator decisions
void sync_with_allocator(
    const std::map<std::string, std::map<std::string, LiveInterval>>& allocations, 
    const std::string& current_function
);

// Reset allocations when starting a new function
void reset_allocations();
```

#### 2. Synchronization Point
Added sync call at the start of each function's code generation:
```cpp
// In NewCodeGenerator::generate_function_like_code()
register_manager_.sync_with_allocator(all_allocations_, unqualified_name);
```

#### 3. Register Reservation Logic
The sync method now:
- Marks LinearScanAllocator-assigned registers as `IN_USE_VARIABLE`
- Updates RegisterManager's internal mapping tables
- Prevents `acquire_scratch_reg()` from returning reserved registers

### Key Files Modified
- `RegisterManager.h`: Added sync method declarations
- `RegisterManager.cpp`: Implemented synchronization logic
- `NewCodeGenerator.cpp`: Added sync call at function entry
- `main.cpp`: Enhanced with sync documentation

## Verification

### Before Fix
```
x = 400 y = 170    ← X always 400 (literal value)
x = 400 y = 343
x = 400 y = 259
```

### After Fix
```
x = 159 y = 285    ← Both X and Y now random!
x = 73 y = 41
x = 380 y = 67
```

## Technical Impact

### Immediate Benefits
- ✅ Random number functions work correctly
- ✅ Variable assignments preserve their values
- ✅ Register conflicts eliminated

### Architectural Improvements
- ✅ **Single Source of Truth**: LinearScanAllocator decisions are authoritative
- ✅ **Unified Register State**: All allocation components share the same view
- ✅ **Prevent Future Bugs**: Template for coordinating allocation components

### Affected Systems
- Random number generation (`RAND`, `RND`, `FRND`)
- Variable assignment integrity
- Expression evaluation with multiple temporary values
- Function call argument preparation

## Prevention Measures

This fix establishes the pattern for preventing similar "two sources of truth" bugs:

1. **Allocation Authority**: LinearScanAllocator is the definitive allocator
2. **Communication Protocol**: All allocation decisions must be synchronized
3. **Validation Points**: Register state consistency is verified at function boundaries

## Test Cases

### Primary Test Case
```bcl
// This pattern was failing before the fix
FOR i = 1 TO 100 DO $(
    LET xx = RAND(400)
    LET yy = RAND(400)
    WRITEF("x = %d y = %d*N", xx, yy)
$)
```

### Verification Commands
```bash
./NewBCPL --run tests/bcl_tests/fern_basic.bcl    # Visual randomness test
./NewBCPL --run test_fern_pattern.bcl             # Targeted assignment test
```

## Related Issues

This fix resolves several related symptoms:
- Graphics programs drawing dots only at position (400, 400)
- Random coordinate generation appearing broken
- Mysterious variable corruption in complex expressions
- Register allocation appearing to "forget" previous assignments

## Lessons Learned

1. **Architectural Coordination**: Complex compilers need explicit coordination between subsystems
2. **Register Allocation Complexity**: Live interval analysis must be coupled with register management
3. **Debugging Assembly**: Low-level traces are essential for register allocation bugs
4. **Single Authority Principle**: Avoid multiple components making decisions about the same resource
