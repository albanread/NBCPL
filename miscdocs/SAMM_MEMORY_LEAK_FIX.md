# SAMM Memory Leak Fix Documentation

## Overview

This document describes a critical memory leak fix in the HeapManager's Scope-Aware Memory Management (SAMM) system. The issue prevented the background cleanup worker from starting when SAMM was enabled, leading to memory accumulation and potential system instability.

## The Problem

### Root Cause Analysis

The HeapManager is designed to use a background thread (`cleanup_worker_`) to handle deallocations asynchronously when SAMM is enabled. However, there was a timing issue in the initialization sequence:

1. **HeapManager Constructor**: The HeapManager is constructed with `samm_enabled_` defaulting to `false`
2. **Constructor Logic**: Only starts the background worker if `samm_enabled_` is already `true`
3. **SAMM Activation**: Later in `main.cpp`, `setSAMMEnabled(true)` is called
4. **Missing Link**: The original `setSAMMEnabled` method did not start the background worker

### Code Flow (Before Fix)

```cpp
// HeapManager constructor
HeapManager::HeapManager() {
    // ... initialization ...
    
    // PROBLEM: samm_enabled_ is false by default
    if (samm_enabled_.load()) {  // This condition is never true
        startBackgroundWorker(); // Never executed
    }
}

// Original setSAMMEnabled method (BROKEN)
void HeapManager::setSAMMEnabled(bool enabled) {
    samm_enabled_.store(enabled);  // Only sets the flag
    // MISSING: No call to startBackgroundWorker()
}
```

### Impact

- **Memory Leak**: Allocated objects accumulated without cleanup
- **Performance Degradation**: Memory pressure increased over time
- **System Instability**: Potential crashes due to excessive memory usage
- **Silent Failure**: The system appeared to work but was slowly degrading

## The Solution

### Fix Implementation

The fix ensures that the background worker is started when SAMM is enabled and stopped when disabled:

```cpp
void HeapManager::setSAMMEnabled(bool enabled) {
    bool was_enabled = samm_enabled_.exchange(enabled);
    
    if (enabled && !was_enabled) {
        traceLog("SAMM: Enabling scope-aware memory management\n");
        startBackgroundWorker(); // THE CRITICAL FIX
    } else if (!enabled && was_enabled) {
        traceLog("SAMM: Disabling scope-aware memory management\n");
        stopBackgroundWorker();
    }
}
```

### Key Changes

1. **Atomic Exchange**: Uses `exchange()` to atomically get the previous value while setting the new one
2. **State Transition Detection**: Checks for actual state changes (`enabled && !was_enabled`)
3. **Worker Management**: Properly starts/stops the background worker based on state transitions
4. **Logging**: Adds trace logging for debugging and monitoring

### Supporting Methods

The fix relies on properly implemented worker management methods:

```cpp
void HeapManager::startBackgroundWorker() {
    if (cleanup_worker_.joinable()) {
        return; // Already running
    }
    
    running_.store(true);
    cleanup_worker_ = std::thread(&HeapManager::cleanupWorker, this);
    traceLog("SAMM: Background cleanup worker started\n");
}

void HeapManager::stopBackgroundWorker() {
    running_.store(false);
    cleanup_cv_.notify_all();
    
    if (cleanup_worker_.joinable()) {
        cleanup_worker_.join();
    }
    
    traceLog("SAMM: Background cleanup worker stopped\n");
}
```

## Testing and Verification

### Test Implementation

A comprehensive test suite was created to verify the fix:

1. **Original Bug Scenario**: Confirms worker starts when SAMM is enabled after construction
2. **Scope Operations**: Verifies that cleanup operations work correctly
3. **Multiple Toggling**: Tests repeated enable/disable cycles
4. **Edge Cases**: Handles multiple calls to enable/disable

### Test Results

All tests pass, confirming:
- ✅ Background worker starts when SAMM is enabled
- ✅ Background worker stops when SAMM is disabled  
- ✅ Worker can be restarted multiple times
- ✅ Scope operations work correctly
- ✅ Memory leak is prevented

## Technical Details

### Thread Safety

The fix maintains thread safety through:
- **Atomic Operations**: Using `std::atomic<bool>` for state flags
- **Mutex Protection**: Proper locking in worker management
- **Condition Variables**: Safe thread synchronization

### Performance Impact

- **Minimal Overhead**: The fix adds negligible performance cost
- **Improved Memory Usage**: Prevents accumulation of unused objects
- **Better Scalability**: Allows long-running programs to maintain stable memory usage

### Backward Compatibility

The fix maintains full backward compatibility:
- **API Unchanged**: No changes to public interfaces
- **Behavior Preserved**: Existing functionality works identically
- **Default State**: SAMM still defaults to disabled for legacy compatibility

## Usage Guidelines

### For Developers

When using SAMM in your code:

```cpp
// Enable SAMM (background worker will start automatically)
HeapManager& heap = HeapManager::getInstance();
heap.setSAMMEnabled(true);

// Use scope-aware memory management
heap.enterScope();
// ... allocate objects ...
heap.exitScope(); // Objects automatically queued for cleanup

// Disable SAMM when done (background worker will stop)
heap.setSAMMEnabled(false);
```

### Configuration

SAMM is enabled by default in `main.cpp`:

```cpp
// Enable SAMM by default for new programs
HeapManager& heap_manager = HeapManager::getInstance();
heap_manager.setSAMMEnabled(true);
```

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Statistics

Monitor SAMM performance using built-in statistics:

```cpp
auto stats = heap.getSAMMStats();
std::cout << "Scopes entered: " << stats.scopes_entered << std::endl;
std::cout << "Objects cleaned: " << stats.objects_cleaned << std::endl;
std::cout << "Worker running: " << stats.background_worker_running << std::endl;
```

### Trace Logging

Enable trace logging to monitor worker lifecycle:

```cpp
heap.setTraceEnabled(true);
```

## Files Modified

- `HeapManager/HeapManager.cpp`: Applied the primary fix to `setSAMMEnabled()`
- `HeapManager/HeapManager.h`: Interface declarations (already correct)
- Test files: Created verification tests

## Conclusion

This fix resolves a critical memory leak in the SAMM system by ensuring the background cleanup worker is properly started when SAMM is enabled. The solution is minimal, safe, and maintains full backward compatibility while preventing potentially severe memory issues in long-running applications.

The fix transforms a potentially catastrophic silent failure into a robust, self-managing memory system that operates as originally designed.
