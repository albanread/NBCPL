# ConstantFoldingPass Class Documentation

## Overview

The `ConstantFoldingPass` class is an optimization pass that simplifies constant expressions in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It traverses the AST and replaces expressions that can be evaluated at compile time with their computed values. This optimization reduces runtime computation and improves performance.

---

## Purpose

The primary goal of the `ConstantFoldingPass` is to identify and evaluate constant expressions during compilation. By folding constants, the compiler can generate more efficient code and eliminate unnecessary calculations.

---

## Key Features

- **Compile-Time Evaluation**: Evaluates constant expressions such as arithmetic operations, boolean logic, and literal values.
- **AST Traversal**: Traverses the AST to locate and simplify constant expressions.
- **Integration with Optimizer**: Extends the `Optimizer` base class to integrate seamlessly with other optimization passes.

---

## Methods

### `apply(ProgramPtr program)`
- **Description**: Applies the constant folding optimization to the given program.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `program`: A pointer to the root of the AST.
- **Returns**: The optimized program AST.

### `is_true(const ExprPtr& expr)`
- **Description**: Determines the truthiness of a given expression.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `expr`: A pointer to an expression node.
- **Returns**: `true` if the expression evaluates to a truthy value, `false` otherwise.

### `visit_expr(ExprPtr expr)`
- **Description**: Visits and potentially modifies an expression node.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `expr`: A pointer to an expression node.
- **Returns**: The modified expression node.

### `visit_stmt(StmtPtr stmt)`
- **Description**: Visits and potentially modifies a statement node.
- **Parameters**: 
  - `stmt`: A pointer to a statement node.
- **Returns**: The modified statement node.

---

## Integration with AST

The `ConstantFoldingPass` interacts with various AST node types, including:

- **Expressions**:
  - `NumberLiteral`: Replaces numeric literals with their computed values.
  - `BooleanLiteral`: Simplifies boolean literals.
  - `BinaryOp`: Evaluates binary operations if both operands are constants.
  - `UnaryOp`: Simplifies unary operations on constant operands.

- **Statements**:
  - `AssignmentStatement`: Simplifies constant expressions in assignments.
  - `RoutineCallStatement`: Evaluates constant arguments in routine calls.

---

## Example Usage

### Input AST
```plaintext
BinaryOp(
    op: Add,
    left: NumberLiteral(5),
    right: NumberLiteral(3)
)
```

### Output AST
```plaintext
NumberLiteral(8)
```

---

## Limitations

- **Side Effects**: Does not evaluate expressions with potential side effects (e.g., function calls).
- **Dynamic Values**: Cannot simplify expressions involving runtime values.
- **Floating Point Precision**: May encounter precision issues when folding floating-point constants.

---

## Summary

The `ConstantFoldingPass` is a crucial optimization step in the compilation process. By simplifying constant expressions, it enhances the efficiency of the generated code and reduces runtime overhead. Its modular design allows easy integration with other optimization passes in the compiler pipeline.
