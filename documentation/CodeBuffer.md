# CodeBuffer Class Documentation

## Overview

The `CodeBuffer` class is responsible for managing the allocation and execution of machine code instructions. It serves as an intermediary between the compiler's code generation phase and the runtime execution environment, ensuring that generated instructions are properly stored and made executable.

---

## Key Responsibilities

1. **Memory Allocation**:
   - Allocates memory for storing machine code instructions.
   - Ensures memory is writable during the code generation phase.

2. **Instruction Encoding**:
   - Converts high-level instruction representations into binary encodings.
   - Copies encoded instructions into the allocated memory buffer.

3. **Executable Memory Management**:
   - Changes memory permissions to make the buffer executable after instructions are committed.

---

## Methods

### `commit(const std::vector<Instruction>& instructions)`
- **Purpose**: Commits a list of instructions to the memory buffer and makes it executable.
- **Parameters**:
  - `instructions`: A vector of `Instruction` objects, each containing a binary encoding.
- **Returns**:
  - A pointer to the executable memory buffer containing the committed instructions.
- **Details**:
  - Calculates the total size required for the instructions.
  - Allocates memory using the `JITMemoryManager`.
  - Copies binary encodings into the allocated buffer.
  - Changes memory permissions to executable.

---

## Dependencies

- **JITMemoryManager**:
  - Handles low-level memory allocation and permission changes.
  - Provides methods for allocating, accessing, and making memory executable.

- **Instruction**:
  - Represents a single machine code instruction.
  - Contains the binary encoding of the instruction.

---

## Example Usage

```cpp
#include "CodeBuffer.h"
#include "Instruction.h"

CodeBuffer code_buffer;
std::vector<Instruction> instructions = {
    Instruction(0xD2800000), // MOV X0, #0
    Instruction(0xD65F03C0)  // RET
};

void* executable_code = code_buffer.commit(instructions);
if (executable_code) {
    // Cast the executable code to a function pointer and call it
    auto func = reinterpret_cast<void(*)()>(executable_code);
    func();
}
```

---

## Notes

- The `CodeBuffer` class assumes a little-endian architecture (e.g., ARM64).
- Proper error handling is required to ensure memory allocation and permission changes succeed.
- The `commit` method should only be called once per buffer lifecycle to avoid overwriting executable memory.

---

## Future Improvements

1. **Error Reporting**:
   - Enhance error handling to provide detailed messages for allocation or execution failures.

2. **Platform Compatibility**:
   - Extend support for other architectures and endianness.

3. **Memory Reuse**:
   - Implement mechanisms to reuse memory buffers for multiple instruction sets.

---

## Summary

The `CodeBuffer` class is a critical component of the `NewBCPL` project, bridging the gap between code generation and runtime execution. Its efficient memory management and instruction encoding capabilities ensure that generated machine code can be executed seamlessly.
