# CFGBuilderPass Class Documentation

## Overview

The `CFGBuilderPass` class is responsible for constructing the Control Flow Graph (CFG) for a given program. It processes the program's Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and generates a graph representation that captures the flow of control between basic blocks.

---

## Key Features

- **Basic Block Management**: Creates and manages basic blocks, including entry and exit points.
- **Control Flow Analysis**: Identifies control flow constructs such as loops, conditionals, and jumps, and maps them to the CFG.
- **Visitor Pattern**: Implements the visitor pattern to traverse the AST and build the CFG.

---

## Class Definition

### Constructor

```cpp
CFGBuilderPass::CFGBuilderPass()
```
Initializes the CFG builder, setting up necessary data structures for basic block management.

---

### Methods

#### `create_new_basic_block()`

Creates a new basic block and adds it to the CFG.

#### `end_current_block_and_start_new()`

Ends the current basic block and starts a new one. This is typically used when transitioning between control flow constructs.

#### `build()`

Starts the CFG construction process by traversing the AST.

#### Visitor Methods

The class implements several `visit` methods to handle different AST node types:

- **Statements**: Processes control flow statements such as `if`, `while`, `for`, and `goto`.
- **Expressions**: Handles expressions that may influence control flow, such as conditional expressions.
- **Declarations**: Processes variable and function declarations that may impact the CFG.

---

## Usage

To use the `CFGBuilderPass` class:

1. Instantiate the class.
2. Call the `build()` method with the program's AST as input.
3. Retrieve the constructed CFG for further analysis or optimization.

---

## Example

```cpp
CFGBuilderPass cfg_builder;
cfg_builder.build(program_ast);
auto cfg = cfg_builder.get_cfg();
```

---

## Notes

- The CFGBuilderPass class assumes a well-formed AST as input.
- It is designed to work with other components of the compiler, such as the optimizer and code generator.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Control Flow Analysis**: Support for advanced constructs like exception handling.
- **Optimization Integration**: Direct integration with optimization passes for CFG-based transformations.
- **Visualization**: Tools to visualize the CFG for debugging and analysis.
