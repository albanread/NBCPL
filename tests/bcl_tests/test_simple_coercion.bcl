// Simple test for assignment-level coercion without WRITEF
// This tests the rule: LET variables are INTEGER, FLET variables are FLOAT
// When assigning a float expression to a LET variable, it should be coerced to integer

LET START() BE
$(
    // Test 1: Integer variable with float expression (should coerce)
    // Expression evaluates to 6.0, should be coerced to integer 6
    LET int_var = 1 + 2.5 * 2

    // Test 2: Float variable with same expression (no coercion)
    // Expression evaluates to 6.0, stored as 6.0
    FLET float_var = 1 + 2.5 * 2

    // Test 3: Integer variable with pure integer expression (no promotion or coercion)
    LET pure_int = 3 * 4

    // Test 4: Float variable with pure integer expression (should promote at assignment)
    FLET promoted_float = 3 * 4

    // Simple output to confirm it runs
    WRITEF("Assignment coercion test completed")
