# **SAMM: Scope Aware Memory Management Implementation Plan**

## **Executive Summary**

SAMM (Scope Aware Memory Management) is a comprehensive overhaul of the NewBCPL compiler's memory management system designed to eliminate critical bugs and provide professional-grade features. The system introduces runtime scope tracking with **asynchronous background cleanup**, explicit ownership control via the RETAIN keyword, and proper compiler pass ordering for reliable code generation.

**Key Innovation**: SAMM leverages modern multi-core systems by performing expensive cleanup operations on a dedicated background thread, making scope exit operations nearly instantaneous on the main execution thread while maintaining correctness guarantees.

## **1. Overview & Architecture**

### **Core Principle: Fast Runtime Scope Tracking with Background Cleanup**
SAMM shifts from compile-time per-variable cleanup to runtime per-scope cleanup using a stack-based approach with asynchronous background processing. This eliminates the fundamental conflict between register allocation and memory lifetime management while providing superior performance characteristics.

**Critical Context**: The current system is fundamentally broken - it would require keeping all heap-allocated objects in registers until scope end, which is impossible given register constraints. The current system already performs complex CFG injection but makes N cleanup calls per scope instead of the optimal single call.

### **Key Components**
1. **Fast Scope Stack Runtime** - Lightweight stack-based tracking of heap allocations per lexical scope
2. **Background Cleanup Engine** - Dedicated thread for performing expensive cleanup operations
3. **RETAIN Ownership Transfer** - Explicit programmer control over object lifetime
4. **Compiler Pass Ordering** - Proper timing for RELEASE synthesis in compilation pipeline

### **Problem Statement**
- **Fundamental architectural flaw**: Current system cannot work - requires unlimited registers
- **Double-free bugs** from register allocator vs cleanup code conflicts
- **Performance overhead**: N cleanup calls per scope instead of optimal single call
- **Memory leaks** on complex control flow (returns, breaks, gotos)
- **Unreliable cleanup** due to improper compiler pass ordering
- **Lack of programmer control** over object lifetime

## **2. SAMM Core: Runtime Scope Management**

### **2.1. Design Philosophy: Ultra-Fast Main Thread + Background Processing**
Instead of injecting individual `p.RELEASE()` calls, the compiler notifies the runtime when scopes are entered/exited. The HeapManager maintains a lightweight stack mirroring lexical scope nesting and queues cleanup work for background processing, making scope operations nearly instantaneous.

**Performance Innovation**: 
- **Main thread**: Only tracks allocations and transfers cleanup work to queue (microseconds)
- **Background thread**: Performs expensive vtable calls and memory deallocation (parallel)
- **Result**: Near-zero overhead on critical execution path while maintaining correctness

### **2.2. Compiler Modifications (CFGBuilderPass)**

#### **Remove Existing Logic**
- **Delete**: All per-variable cleanup injection in `CFGBuilderPass::visit(BlockStatement&)`
- **Delete**: Individual `RELEASE()` call generation for local variables

#### **Add Scope Boundary Injection**
```cpp
// At beginning of CFGBuilderPass::visit(BlockStatement&)
void CFGBuilderPass::visit(BlockStatement& stmt) {
    // Inject scope entry
    injectRuntimeCall("HeapManager_enter_scope");
    
    // Process block contents...
    
    // Inject scope exit on ALL control flow exits:
    // 1. Normal fall-through
    // 2. Early RETURN/RESULTIS  
    // 3. BREAK/LOOP statements
    // 4. GOTO statements (with nested scope handling)
    injectScopeExitOnAllPaths();
}
```

#### **Critical: Multi-Exit Path Handling**
```cpp
// For GOTO jumping out of multiple nested scopes
void handleNestedScopeExit(int scope_levels) {
    for (int i = 0; i < scope_levels; i++) {
        injectRuntimeCall("HeapManager_exit_scope");
    }
}
```

### **2.3. Runtime Modifications (HeapManager)**

#### **New Data Structure: Dual-Thread Architecture**
```cpp
// In HeapManager.h
private:
    // Main thread data (minimal locking)
    std::stack<std::vector<void*>> scope_allocations_;
    std::mutex scope_mutex_;  // Ultra-lightweight operations only
    
    // Background cleanup data
    std::queue<std::vector<void*>> cleanup_queue_;
    std::mutex cleanup_mutex_;
    std::condition_variable cleanup_cv_;
    std::thread cleanup_worker_;
    std::atomic<bool> running_{true};
```

#### **Ultra-Fast Allocation Tracking**
```cpp
// In HeapManager.cpp - modify ALL allocation functions
void* HeapManager::allocObject(size_t size, const char* func, const char* var) {
    // ... existing allocation logic ...
    void* ptr = posix_memalign(...);
    
    // SAMM: Ultra-fast registration with current scope
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(scope_mutex_);  // Minimal critical section
    if (!scope_allocations_.empty()) {
        scope_allocations_.top().push_back(ptr);  // Simple vector operation
    }
    
    return ptr;
}
```

#### **Lightning-Fast Runtime Functions with Background Processing**
```cpp
// In HeapManager_scope.cpp (new file)
extern "C" void HeapManager_enter_scope() {
    HeapManager::getInstance().enterScope();
}

extern "C" void HeapManager_exit_scope() {
    HeapManager::getInstance().exitScope();
}

// In HeapManager.cpp
void HeapManager::enterScope() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(scope_mutex_);  // Minimal lock
    scope_allocations_.push({}); // New empty vector for new scope
}

// CRITICAL: Ultra-fast scope exit - no cleanup on main thread!
void HeapManager::exitScope() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(scope_mutex_);
    if (scope_allocations_.empty()) return;
    
    // Move entire scope to cleanup queue - O(1) operation
    std::vector<void*> scope_ptrs = std::move(scope_allocations_.top());
    scope_allocations_.pop();
    
    // Queue for background processing - separate lock for minimal contention
    {
        std::lock_guard<std::mutex> cleanup_lock(cleanup_mutex_);
        cleanup_queue_.push(std::move(scope_ptrs));
    }
    cleanup_cv_.notify_one();
    
    // Return immediately - main thread never blocks on cleanup!
}

// Background cleanup worker thread
void HeapManager::cleanupWorker() {
    while (running_.load()) {
        std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(cleanup_mutex_);
        cleanup_cv_.wait(lock, [this] { 
            return !cleanup_queue_.empty() || !running_.load(); 
        });
        
        while (!cleanup_queue_.empty()) {
            auto ptrs = std::move(cleanup_queue_.front());
            cleanup_queue_.pop();
            lock.unlock();
            
            // Perform expensive cleanup work off main thread
            for (auto it = ptrs.rbegin(); it != ptrs.rend(); ++it) {
                void* ptr = *it;
                
                auto block_it = heap_blocks_.find(ptr);
                if (block_it != heap_blocks_.end()) {
                    AllocType type = block_it->second.type;
                    
                    if (type == ALLOC_OBJECT) {
                        // Expensive vtable call - done in background
                        if (ptr) {
                            void** vtable = *static_cast<void***>(ptr);
                            using ReleaseFunc = void (*)(void*);
                            ReleaseFunc release_method = reinterpret_cast<ReleaseFunc>(vtable[1]);
                            
                            if (release_method) {
                                release_method(ptr); // Calls Heap_free internally
                            }
                        }
                    } else {
                        // Direct free for vectors, strings, etc.
                        this->free(ptr);
                    }
                }
            }
            
            lock.lock();
        }
    }
}

// Memory pressure handling - force immediate cleanup if needed
void HeapManager::handleMemoryPressure() {
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(cleanup_mutex_);
    while (!cleanup_queue_.empty()) {
        // Process queue immediately on main thread if memory tight
        auto ptrs = std::move(cleanup_queue_.front());
        cleanup_queue_.pop();
        lock.unlock();
        
        // Immediate cleanup when memory pressure detected
        for (auto it = ptrs.rbegin(); it != ptrs.rend(); ++it) {
            performActualCleanup(*it);
        }
        
        lock.lock();
    }
}

// Shutdown handling - ensure all cleanup completes
void HeapManager::shutdown() {
    running_.store(false);
    cleanup_cv_.notify_all();
    if (cleanup_worker_.joinable()) {
        cleanup_worker_.join();
    }
}
```

## **3. RETAIN: Explicit Ownership Transfer**

### **3.1. Purpose & Semantics**
RETAIN provides programmer-directed opt-out from automatic scope cleanup by transferring ownership to parent scopes.

### **3.2. Syntax Support**
- `LET p = NEW Point` → Object owned by current scope
- `RETAIN p = NEW Point` → Object owned by parent scope  
- `RETAIN p` → Transfer existing object to parent scope

### **3.3. Implementation Strategy**

#### **Compiler Code Generation**
```cpp
// In NewCodeGenerator::visit(LetDeclaration&)
if (decl.is_retained) {
    // Generate call to retained allocation variant
    generateCall("OBJECT_HEAP_ALLOC_RETAINED", args);
} else {
    // Generate call to standard allocation
    generateCall("OBJECT_HEAP_ALLOC", args);
}

// In NewCodeGenerator::visit(RetainStatement&)
// Load pointer value into register X0
// Generate call to HeapManager_retain_pointer(X0)
```

#### **Runtime Allocation Variants**
```cpp
// Create retained versions of all allocation functions
void* HeapManager::allocObjectRetained(size_t size, const char* func, const char* var) {
    void* ptr = this->allocObject(size, func, var); // Perform allocation
    
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(heap_mutex_);
    if (scope_allocations_.size() > 1) {
        // Add to parent scope's vector
        auto& parent_scope = *std::next(scope_allocations_.rbegin());
        parent_scope.push_back(ptr);
        
        // Remove from current scope (was added by allocObject)
        auto& current_scope = scope_allocations_.top();
        current_scope.erase(
            std::remove(current_scope.begin(), current_scope.end(), ptr),
            current_scope.end());
    }
    // If no parent scope, object becomes globally persistent
    
    return ptr;
}
```

#### **Ownership Transfer Function**
```cpp
void HeapManager::retainPointer(void* ptr) {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(heap_mutex_);
    if (scope_allocations_.size() < 2) {
        // Retaining in global scope makes it globally persistent
        if (!scope_allocations_.empty()) {
            auto& top_scope = scope_allocations_.top();
            top_scope.erase(
                std::remove(top_scope.begin(), top_scope.end(), ptr),
                top_scope.end());
        }
        return;
    }
    
    auto& current_scope = scope_allocations_.top();
    auto& parent_scope = *std::next(scope_allocations_.rbegin());
    
    // Move pointer from current to parent scope
    auto it = std::find(current_scope.begin(), current_scope.end(), ptr);
    if (it != current_scope.end()) {
        parent_scope.push_back(*it);
        current_scope.erase(it);
    }
}
```

## **4. Compiler Pass Ordering Fix**

### **4.1. Problem & Solution**
**Problem**: RELEASE synthesis in ClassPass occurs too early, AST modifications lost
**Solution**: Move RELEASE synthesis to ASTAnalyzer after all transformations

### **4.2. Correct Pipeline Order**
```
Parse AST → ClassPass (metadata only) → AST transformations → 
ASTAnalyzer (RELEASE synthesis) → Code Generation
```

### **4.3. Implementation**
```cpp
// In ASTAnalyzer::visit(RoutineDeclaration&)
if (routine.name == "RELEASE" && current_class_name_) {
    // Inject cleanup code using _this parameter
    // Handle both BlockStatement and CompoundStatement bodies
    injectCleanupCode(routine, "_this");
}
```

## **5. Performance Analysis & Benchmarking Strategy**

### **5.1. Performance Advantages of Background Architecture**

#### **Main Thread Performance (Critical Path)**
- **Allocation tracking**: Single `vector.push_back()` - O(1), ~10-50 nanoseconds
- **Scope exit**: Move vector to queue - O(1), ~100-500 nanoseconds  
- **Zero vtable calls** on main thread execution path
- **Zero expensive memory operations** blocking main thread
- **Deterministic timing** - no cleanup variance affecting execution

#### **Background Thread Benefits**
- **Batch processing** - better cache locality for metadata operations
- **Parallel execution** - cleanup happens while main thread continues
- **Optimizable strategies** - can implement sophisticated cleanup ordering
- **Scalable** - multiple cleanup threads possible for high-allocation workloads

#### **Comparison with Current System**
```
Current System (per scope):
- N individual RELEASE calls = N × (vtable lookup + method call + free)
- All on main thread, blocking execution
- Estimated: N × 1-10 microseconds

SAMM System (per scope):
- 1 ultra-fast queue operation = ~500 nanoseconds  
- Background processing parallel to main execution
- Net main thread overhead: ~500 nanoseconds vs N × 1-10 microseconds
- Performance improvement: 20-2000x faster scope exit
```

### **5.2. Memory Overhead Analysis**
- **Scope stack**: ~8 bytes per allocation pointer
- **Cleanup queue**: Temporary storage during background processing
- **Thread overhead**: ~8MB stack + minimal control structures
- **Total overhead**: <1% for typical allocation patterns
