# Inspiration of NewBCPL

## The Dawn of CPL in the UK

In the annals of computing history, the United Kingdom holds a special place, particularly for its pioneering work in programming language design. It was in this environment of academic excellence and innovation that **CPL (Combined Programming Language)** was born in the early 1960s. A collaborative effort between the University of Cambridge and the University of London, CPL was an ambitious project. It aimed to create a language that was both powerful enough for system programming and elegant enough for the complexities of scientific computation. However, its grand vision also became its Achilles' heel. CPL was a large and complex language, making it difficult to implement on the limited hardware of the era.

## The Rise of a Practical Successor: BCPL

From the lessons learned with CPL, a new, more pragmatic language emerged: **BCPL (Basic Combined Programming Language)**. Developed by Martin Richards at the University of Cambridge in 1966, BCPL stripped away the complexities of its predecessor, focusing on simplicity and portability. It was a typeless language, dealing directly with machine words, which made it incredibly flexible and efficient for system programming. BCPL's influence was profound; it was the language used to write the first "Hello, World!" program and was a direct ancestor of the B programming language, which in turn led to the creation of C.

## A New Chapter: NewBCPL

Decades later, the spirit of BCPL – its simplicity, power, and closeness to the hardware – continues to inspire. **NewBCPL** is a modern homage to this legacy. While we deeply respect the foundational principles of BCPL, we also recognize that the computing landscape has changed dramatically. The goals of NewBCPL are:

1.  **To honor the spirit of BCPL:** We aim to retain the core simplicity and efficiency that made BCPL so influential. NewBCPL provides a clear and direct mapping to the underlying hardware, empowering programmers with control and transparency.

2.  **To embrace modern requirements:** We are extending BCPL's legacy with the minium set of features that we find essential for contemporary software development.

3.  **To pursue simplicity in the best sense:** NewBCPL is designed to be easy to learn and reason about, without sacrificing performance or control.

 ## Embracing the Modern Machine

 The original BCPL was engineered for a world of scarce resources. Today, we live in an era of computational abundance. NewBCPL is designed to take advantage of the **modern hardware** extravagance at our disposal.  Our goal is to provide direct access to this power without unnecessary abstraction.

 With this focus on modern hardware comes a pragmatic admission: our primary target is the development of **native applications**. The elegant, highly portable design of the original BCPL compiler, which could be bootstrapped on a highly constrained new machine in a matter of weeks, is a feat we admire but do not replicate.
